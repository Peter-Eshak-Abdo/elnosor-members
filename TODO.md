# TODO: Add Breadcrumbs to All Pages

## Tasks
- [ ] Add Breadcrumbs component to app/dashboard/layout.tsx
- [ ] Add Breadcrumbs component to app/layout.tsx for non-dashboard pages
- [ ] Remove manual Breadcrumbs imports from individual pages (e.g., app/about/page.tsx, app/members/[id]/page.tsx)
- [ ] Test breadcrumb functionality on various pages
- [ ] Adjust styling if needed for proper integration

## Notes
- Breadcrumbs component already exists and has logic to hide on /dashboard
- Ensure no duplication of breadcrumbs on pages that already have them manually added
